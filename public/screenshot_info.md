# Screenshot Information

To add a screenshot to your README, you'll need to:

1. Take a screenshot of the game in action
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in this directory
3. The screenshot will then appear in your README on GitHub

## Suggested Screenshot

For the best presentation, consider taking a screenshot that shows:

- The game board with some filled cells
- The in-cell roller picker open on a selected cell
- The dark theme with vibrant colors
- Preferably showing one of the emoji or fruit game modes

## Example Screenshot Description

The screenshot should showcase the beautiful dark UI with its purple accents, the sudoku board with some numbers/emojis filled in, and the innovative in-cell roller picker that allows number selection while still seeing the entire board.

This will give potential users a clear visual of what makes your Sudoku Variants game special compared to other Sudoku apps.
